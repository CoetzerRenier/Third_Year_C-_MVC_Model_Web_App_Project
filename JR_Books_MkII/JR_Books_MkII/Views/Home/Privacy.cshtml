    <p>At JR Books, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains our policies and practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use our website.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect personal information that you provide to us voluntarily when you register on our website, place an order, or subscribe to our newsletter. This information may include your name, email address, mailing address, and payment information.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to process your orders, communicate with you about your orders, send you promotional offers and newsletters if you have subscribed, and improve our website and services.</p>

    <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties without your consent, except as necessary to fulfill your orders (e.g., sharing your address with our shipping partners) or as required by law.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
